# qsv Data Wrangling - Workflow Guide

This CLAUDE.md was auto-deployed by the qsv plugin to provide workflow guidance.
You can edit or replace it — it will NOT be overwritten on future sessions.
To disable auto-deployment, set `QSV_NO_COWORK_SETUP=1` in your shell environment before launching Claude Code.

## Workflow Order

For new files:
1. **`qsv_list_files`** to discover files in the working directory
2. **`qsv_index`** for files >10MB (enables faster processing)
3. **`qsv_stats --cardinality --stats-jsonl`** to create a stats cache
4. Then run analysis/transformation commands

The stats cache accelerates: `frequency`, `schema`, `tojsonl`, `sqlp`, `joinp`, `pivotp`, `describegpt`, `moarstats`, `sample`.

`qsv_sqlp` auto-converts CSV inputs to Parquet before execution.

## File Handling

- Save outputs to files with descriptive names rather than returning large results to chat.
- Ensure output files are saved to the qsv working directory.
- **Parquet** is ONLY for `sqlp`/DuckDB; all other qsv commands require CSV/TSV/SSV input.
- **Spreadsheets** (`.xls`, `.xlsx`, `.xlsm`, `.xlsb`, `.ods`) must be converted to CSV first using `qsv_command` with `command="excel"` before other qsv commands can process them.
- The working directory is automatically synced from the MCP client's root directory when available.
- If the auto-synced directory is incorrect or no root is provided, call **`qsv_set_working_dir`** to set it manually.
- In Claude Cowork, verify the working directory matches the "Work in a folder" path by calling **`qsv_get_working_dir`**, and correct it with **`qsv_set_working_dir`** if needed.

## Tool Composition

- **`qsv_sqlp`** auto-converts CSV inputs to Parquet, then routes to DuckDB when available for better SQL compatibility and performance; falls back to Polars SQL otherwise.
- For multi-file SQL queries, convert all files to Parquet first with **`qsv_to_parquet`**, then use `read_parquet()` references in SQL.
- For custom row-level logic, use **`qsv_command`** with `command="luau"`.

## Memory Limits

Commands `dedup`, `sort`, `reverse`, `table`, `transpose`, `pragmastat`, and `stats` (with extended stats) load entire files into memory.

For files >1GB, prefer `extdedup`/`extsort` alternatives via **`qsv_command`**.

Check column cardinality with **`qsv_stats`** before running `frequency` or `pivotp` to avoid huge output.

## Tool Discovery

Use **`qsv_search_tools`** to discover commands beyond the initially loaded core tools. There are 51 qsv skill-based commands available covering selection, filtering, transformation, aggregation, joining, validation, formatting, conversion, and more. Tool names may change across versions; check `qsv_search_tools` if any are unrecognized.

## Operation Timeout

qsv operations can take significant time on larger files. The MCP server's default operation timeout is 10 minutes (configurable via `QSV_MCP_OPERATION_TIMEOUT_MS`, max 30 minutes). Allow operations to run to completion.

## Cowork-Specific Notes

- **Path Architecture**: qsv runs on the HOST machine. File paths must be valid
  on the host. Always verify with `qsv_get_working_dir`.
- **Sequential Operations**: Prefer sequential over parallel qsv calls to avoid
  queuing delays: index → stats → analysis.
- **Large Files (>5GB)**: Let `qsv_frequency` run to completion (server timeout
  is 10 min). Only fall back to `qsv_sqlp` with GROUP BY if the server timeout
  is exceeded. Use `extsort`/`extdedup` via `qsv_command` instead of `sort`/`dedup`.
- **Context Window**: Save outputs to files rather than returning to chat.
  Use `qsv_slice` or `qsv_sqlp` with LIMIT to inspect subsets.
